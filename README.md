# CAPTCHA Verification System

This project is a custom CAPTCHA verification system designed to enhance user experience while ensuring that users are not robots. The system uses a series of images that are randomly shuffled every time, with a checkbox for the user to confirm that they are human.

## Features
- **Randomized Image Display**: Nine images are displayed, with a new arrangement every time the page is loaded.
- **Checkbox Validation**: Users must check the box that says "I am not a robot" to confirm they are human.
- **Retry Button**: Allows users to reload the CAPTCHA images if needed, ensuring flexibility in user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The basic structure of the webpage, including the checkbox and image elements.
- **CSS**: Styling to make the page visually appealing, with a modern and user-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for shuffling images, handling user input, and displaying the correct validation message.

## How to Use
1. **Load the Page**: Open the HTML file in your browser to see the CAPTCHA system.
2. **Verify**: Check the "I am not a robot" box after reviewing the images.
3. **Retry**: If you wish to change the images, click the "Retry" button to shuffle them.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Ensure you have a local server or simply open the HTML file directly in a browser.
